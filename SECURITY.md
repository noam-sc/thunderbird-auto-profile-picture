# Auto Profile Picture Privacy Policy

This extension uses several external services to provide the functionality. The privacy policy of these services is as follows:

## CloudFlare DNS

Cloudflare DNS is used to resolve BIMI records associated with email addresses.

Their privacy policy can be found [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver/).

In short, Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver, developed with APNIC, is designed for privacy by encrypting DNS requests to prevent spying, not selling or using personal data for advertising, anonymizing IP addresses, retaining data only for operational purposes and limited time, and allowing APNIC access to anonymized logs for research.

## DuckDuckGo

DuckDuckGo is used to retrieve website icons.

Their privacy policy can be found [here](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy) and specifically for the icons [here](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/favicons/).

## Gravatar

Gravatar is used to retrieve user avatars.
